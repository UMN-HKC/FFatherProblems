``` java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        int curEnd = 0, curFarthest = 0, jump = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            curFarthest = Math.max(curFarthest, nums[i] + i);
            if (curEnd == i) {
                jump++;
                curEnd = curFarthest;
                
                if (curFarthest == nums.length - 1) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return jump;
    }
}

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* This is an implicit bfs solution. i == curEnd means you visited all the items on the current level. Incrementing jumps++ 
is like incrementing the level you are on. And curEnd = curFarthest is like getting the queue size (level size) for the next
level you are traversing. Note that we can break out the loop earlier if we have already seen that farthest reaching nums.length - 1.
It is nums.length - 1 instead of nums.length because at this point, we also increment our jump by 1 which means we make a jump.
