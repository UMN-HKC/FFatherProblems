## Solution1 (insert Index)
``` java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0)   return;
        int insertPos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                swap(nums, insertPos++, i);
            }
        }
    }
    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

## Solution2 (keep two pointers)

## note
* The idea for solution1 is to move non-zero elements as far left as possible.
* A naive solution to keep two pointers: one tries to find zero elements and the other tries to find non-zero elements.
Once found, swap them. The loop exits when non-zero pointer reaches the end of the array which means we have moved all
non-zero elements to the front.
