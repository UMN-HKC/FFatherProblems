## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)   return 0;
        int[] max = new int[1];
        max[0] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        helper(root, max);
        return max[0];
    }
    private int helper(TreeNode root, int[] max) {
        if (root == null)   return 0;
        int left = Math.max(0, helper(root.left, max));
        int right = Math.max(0, helper(root.right, max));
        max[0] = Math.max(max[0], root.val + left + right);
        return root.val + Math.max(left, right);
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(h)
* Recursion approach. The idea is to use a max variable to keep track of the maximum path sum when traversing the tree. In the helper function, we do three things: get the maxValue from the left subtree, get the maxValue from the right subtree, and get
the maxValue for the current tree. We use 0 as a cutting line which means if values from left or right subtree is less than 0, we will not take it. But when we do updating max, we still need to compare the sum of left, right, and root itself with max.
Finally, we will return the larger sum subtree to the last call in the stack.
* Remember to initialize the max variable to be Integer.MIN_VALUE instead of 0 so it won't interfere with comparison.
