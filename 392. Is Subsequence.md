``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        // build our dictionary
        List<Integer>[] dic = new ArrayList[256];
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            if (dic[t.charAt(i)] == null) {
                dic[t.charAt(i)] = new ArrayList<>();
            } 
            dic[t.charAt(i)].add(i);
        }
        // search 
        int prev = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (dic[s.charAt(i)] == null) {
                return false;
            }
            int pos = Collections.binarySearch(dic[s.charAt(i)], prev);
            if (pos < 0) {
                pos = -(pos + 1); 
            }
            if (pos == dic[s.charAt(i)].size()) {
                return false;
            }
            prev = dic[s.charAt(i)].get(pos) + 1;
        }
        return true;  
    }
}

## note
* time O(T) for initializing, O(len(S)*log(lenT)) for each look-up 
* The idea is to use an array where each position in the array stores potential list of indices of occurences of respective 
characters in T. Then, when we want to check if S is a subsequence of T, we go through each character in S and use a prev variable
to keep track of last occurence position of last character in S and make sure the current index takes on the smallest index that
is greater than the prev variable. To achive this, we use Java's Collections.binarySearch() method. Quoted from Java documentation,
```
the index of the search key, if it is contained in the list; otherwise, (-(insertion point) - 1). The insertion point is 
defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into the list: the index of the first element greater than the key, 
or list.size() if all elements in the list are less than the specified key. 
```
So, if returned index is less than 0, it means that the prev index does not found in the current list of indices (we could either take the smallest index
in the current list or return false if -(pos + 1) == s.length()). 
* Remember to increment prev by 1 after each iteration.
