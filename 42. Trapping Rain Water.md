## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        int sum = 0, leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            leftMax = Math.max(height[left], leftMax);
            rightMax = Math.max(height[right], rightMax);
            if (leftMax < rightMax) {
                sum += leftMax - height[left];
                left++;
            }
            else {
                sum += rightMax - height[right];
                right--;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to use two pointers, one starting from left and one from right. Keep another two variables called leftMax and 
rightMax that keeps track of the max height from each side and which get updated once the moving two pointers meets higher 
height than the current max height. Note that the amount of water to be added is determined by the smaller max side. We will
keep moving the smaller side pointer until the smaller side's max gets grerater than the other side's max and then we will 
switch to move the other side. Be careful that we only move one side at a time because we don't want two sides' max change at
the same time.
