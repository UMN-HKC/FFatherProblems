## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        int sum = 0, leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            leftMax = Math.max(height[left], leftMax);
            rightMax = Math.max(height[right], rightMax);
            if (leftMax < rightMax) {
                sum += leftMax - height[left];
                left++;
            }
            else {
                sum += rightMax - height[right];
                right--;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

## note
* The idea is to use two pointers, one starting from left and one from right. Keep another two variables called leftMax and 
rightMax that keeps track of the max height from each side and which get updated once the moving two pointers meets higher 
height than the current max height. Also, we only add the difference of height from the shorter max side. 
* time O(n) space O(1)
