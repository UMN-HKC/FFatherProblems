## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int[] G = new int[n + 1];
        G[0] = G[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                G[i] += G[j - 1] * G[i - j];
            }
        }
        return G[n];
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n^2) space O(n)
* The idea is to use DP to solve this problem. We can see calculating G(n) which is the solution as calculating the sum of 
number of unique structure of 1 as root, 2 as root, 3 as root..., n as root. And for each i as root, we say 
f(i, n) = G[i -1] + G[n - i]. For example, if we want G(8), when we are calculating f(3, 8), we would want to know G[3-1] and
G[8 - 3].
