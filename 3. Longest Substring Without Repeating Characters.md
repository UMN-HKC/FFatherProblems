## Solution1

``` java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(s.charAt(i))) {
                j = Math.max(j, map.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1);
            }
            map.put(s.charAt(i), i);
            max = Math.max(max, i - j + 1);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to use two pointers and hashmap to store characters and their indices in the string. One pointer keeps iterating
through the string, when it encounters a repeating character, the other pointer will get updates to the position right after 
that previous repeating character. Since every time we encounter repeating characters, we move the other pointer to the character
right after that repeating character, we always have substring from j to i without repeating characters. Note that when we update
j pointer, we do j = Math.max(j, map.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1) because the repeating character we just met might already been skipped
during previous updates.
