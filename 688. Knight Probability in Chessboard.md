## Solution1 (dp)
``` java
class Solution {
    private int[][] dirs = {{-2, -1}, {-1, -2}, {1, -2}, {2, -1}, {2, 1}, {1, 2}, {-1, 2}, {-2, 1}};
    public double knightProbability(int N, int K, int r, int c) {
        double[][] dp0 = new double[N][N];
        for (double[] row : dp0) {
            Arrays.fill(row, 1);
        }
        for (int l = 0; l < K; l++) {
            double[][] dp1 = new double[N][N];
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                    for (int[] dir : dirs) {
                        int x = i + dir[0];
                        int y = j + dir[1];
                        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= N || y >= N) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        dp1[x][y] += dp0[i][j];
                    }
                }
            }
            dp0 = dp1;

## note
* time O(K * N^2) space O(N^2)
* Initially I thought about starting from the knight's position and from there do a dfs to find out all possible valid results.
The idea is to decrement K by 1 each time we make a valid move. However, this approach resulted in TLE. After checking out discussion
board, I find that this problem is better solved using dp.
* The idea of applying dp here is to iterate through each grid for K times(K moves), each time accumulate the number of all 
valid moves into each grid. Before next iteration, we swap the temporary 2-d array with our original 2-d array so we have all
record from last step (we could see this temporary 2-d array as cache). Then, when doing next iteration of traversing the whole
grid, we will have number of all valid moves of last move in each grid prepared. After K moves, we can simply retrive dp0[r][c]
which stores the number of valid moves after K steps if we start from position [r][c].
