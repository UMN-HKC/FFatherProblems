## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[slow];
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }
        fast = 0;
        while (slow != fast) {
            fast = nums[fast];
            slow = nums[slow];
        }
        return slow;
    }
}
```

## note 
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to apply slow and fast pointer idea which is similar in the problem Linked List Cycle. The trick is to realize 
that we have array of size n and numbers from 1 to n - 1 so indexing using numbers will not cause IndexOutOfBounds Exception.
Therefore, indexing once is our slow pointer and indexing twice is our fast pointer respectively within move.
