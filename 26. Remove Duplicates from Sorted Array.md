``` java

    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int i = 0, j = 1;
        while (j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[j] == nums[j - 1]) {
                j++;
            }
            else {
                nums[++i] = nums[j++];
            }
        }
        return i+ 1;

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to have two pointers: one points to the position of last unique number and the other one iterates the rest of the
array and find the rest unique characters. Once a unique number found, we insert it to the 'unique' pointer's position. When we
are done with the first iteration, we have our result and we are done since we don't have to deal with the rest of numbers.
