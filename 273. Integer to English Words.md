## note
* time O(n)
* create three string arrays to store </br>
  1). numbers less than 20 </br>
  2). numbers of tens </br>
  3). thousand, million, billion </br>
* The idea is that we process the number from right to left by 1000 which means we pass (num % 1000) to helper function and then divide num by 1000 to the next iteration. Be careful that if num % 1000 == 0, we don't pass it directly. Increment i in at the end of each iteration to access next word in THOUSANDS.
* In the helper function, we have four conditions: 1). num == 0 2). num < 20 3). num < 100 4). other(num < 1000). We only append an extra space after num < 20 condition (consider a number like 50868, if we also append an extra space in the condition num < 100, there will be two space after "fifty"). So, in the while loop in our numberToWords() function, we don't append extra space between helper() and THOUSAND[i] because we already handles that in condition number < 20 in helper function. 
* Notice that the first element of each string array is "". We only pass number that is less than 1000 to the helper function and we use number as index to directly access the respective english word. 
* Handle 0 as "Zero" separately
