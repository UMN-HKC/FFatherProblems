## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int left = minDepth(root.left);
        int right = minDepth(root.right);
        return (left == 0 || right == 0) ? left + right + 1 : Math.min(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```

## note
* The idea is to keep the shorter subtree if neither of their depth is 0. If one of the subtrees' length is 0, we simply 
increment current length by 1. 
* Be careful that the shortest path for [1, 2] is 2 instead of 1.
