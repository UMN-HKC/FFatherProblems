## Solution1 (binary search)
``` java
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] A) {
        int start = 0, end = A.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (A[mid] < A[mid + 1]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
            else if (A[mid] > A[mid + 1]) {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(logn) space O(1)
* Since there's only one peak, we can apply binary search, because an element is either increasing to the peak or decreasing 
from the peak.
