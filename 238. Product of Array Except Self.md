## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 2) {
            return nums;
        }
        int[] res = new int[nums.length];
        int left = 1, right = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
            res[i] = left;
            left *= nums[i];
        }
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            res[i] *= right;
            right *= nums[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to sweep twice from left to right and right to left and storing result to our result array. We will use two variables
to keep track of the previous product. When sweeping from left to right, we first set the current position's value to product 
of its previous elements, and then multiply number[i] to the product variable so that it could used for next adjacent element.
