## Solution1 (dfs faster) 
``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Set<String> words = new HashSet<>(wordDict);
        return dfs(s, 0, visited, words);
    }
    private boolean dfs(String s, int index, Set<Integer> visited, Set<String> wordDict) {
        if (index == s.length()) return true;
        if (visited.contains(index)) return false;
        // recursion
        for (int i = index + 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            if (wordDict.contains(s.substring(index, i))) {
                if (dfs(s, i, visited, wordDict))
                    return true;
                else {
                    visited.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
        visited.add(index);
        return false;
    }
}
```
* time O(n^2) space O(n)
* The idea is to btute force solve this question by checking at each index, whether the dictionary contains its left word && its right substring is breakable. However, we need to reduce duplication by storing the unbreakable index so that next time we come to this index again, we know that we do not even need to check this index which eliminates a lot of duplicate operations. 
* Be very careful that we only add an index to our unbreakable for two situations:</br>
1). Within the loop, if at this index, the left string does not exist in the dictionary and its right substring is not breakable.</br> Also, pay close attention that if wordDict does not contain left string, we don't necessarily add this index into visited,<strong> we only add it to visited when left does not exist in dict and right substring is not breakable.</strong>
2). At the end of the function, we add the index to the unbreakable set since after iterating through the string, we haven't returned true earlier. 

## Solution2 (dp bottom-up)
``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[s.length() + 1];
        dp[0] = true;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < dp.length; i++) {
            String cur = s.substring(0, i);
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                if (dp[i - j] && wordDict.contains(s.substring(i - j, i))) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[dp.length - 1];
    }
}
```
## note
* dp solution bottom up: a substring can break into words in dictionary only if at some point in this substring, the 
substring of this current substring is breakable and after that point to the end of the current substring is within 
our dictionary
