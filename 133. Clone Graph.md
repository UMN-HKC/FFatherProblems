## note
* time O(n) space O(n)
* The idea is to breadth first search the original graph and meanwhile clone each node. There are several points in this solution
that are subtle when implementing: 
1). We use hashmap to map original graph node and its cloned nodes. In here, the hashmap plays several roles. It stores the 
cloned graph nodes mapped by their respective original nodes. Besides, the hashmap also checks if a node has been added to the 
queue.</br>
2). When we are cloning neighbors, if we have already visited this neighbor node(hashmap already contains it), we don't put 
this node into our queue(so we don't revisit what we have visited). But even if we have visited a node, we will always
add the neighbor to our cloned node. 
*  One corner case to consider is that the node to clone is only itself with its only neighbor is itself. That's why we pull the checking at the beginning of the neighbors iteration, so we don't create a new duplicate node, while we always add currently visiting neighbor to current clone node's neighbors.
