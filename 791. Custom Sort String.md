## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public String customSortString(String S, String T) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (char c : T.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : S.toCharArray()) {
            while (count[c - 'a']-- > 0) {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        for (char c : T.toCharArray()) {
            while (count[c - 'a']-- > 0) {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(T) space O(1)
* The idea is to use an array to store frequency of characters in T string. Then, iterate through S string which is the order 
string, append all characters in S that are also present in T, and each time appending characters we decrement the frequency 
of that character in our array. After iterating through S string, then we come to our T string, appending all the rest of 
characters that are not in S string to the end of our result string.
