``` java
class Solution {
    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int len1 = nums1.length;
        int len2 = nums2.length;
        
        if (len1 > len2) {
            return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);
        }
        int k = (len1 + len2 + 1) / 2;
        int m1 = 0, m2 = 0;
        int start = 0, end = len1;
        
        while (start < end) {
            m1 = start + (end - start) / 2;
            m2 = k - m1;
            if (nums1[m1] < nums2[m2 - 1]) {
                start = m1 + 1;
            }
            else {
                end = m1;
            }
        }
        m1 = start;
        m2 = k - start;
        
        int c1 = Math.max(m1 == 0 ? Integer.MIN_VALUE : nums1[m1 - 1],
                         m2 == 0 ? Integer.MIN_VALUE : nums2[m2 - 1]);
        if ((len1 + len2) % 2 == 1) {
            return c1;
        }
        int c2 = Math.min(m1 == len1 ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : nums1[m1], 
                         m2 == len2 ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : nums2[m2]);
        return 0.5 * (c1 + c2);
    }
}

## note
* time O(log(m + n)) space O(1)
* The idea is to use binary search to locate m1 and m2 which are two possible left median point in two arrays, and then we can get the median value easily.
* There are many edge cases to consider. Like after the while loop, when we are trying to get c1(median point), we need to get the greater value from two potential median points which are m1 and m2. When getting the max from these two, we will have to first check if m1 and m2 are 0. If so, it m1 is 0, it means the median is m2, and it is same idea the other way around. Also, 
if array size is even, we need to get the right median point. And when calculating that, we also need to check m1 and m2, but for getting right median point, we check whether m1 or m2 has reached the end. If one of them has reached the end, we want right median from the other array.
* Remember that we use len1 = nums1.length instead of nums1.length - 1 in this problem. Also, if len1 > len2, we will change the sequence so that we always iterate the shorter array to optimize time complexity.
