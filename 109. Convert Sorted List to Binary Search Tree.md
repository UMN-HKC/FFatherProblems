        }

    }
    private TreeNode buildBST(ListNode head, ListNode tail) {
        if (head == tail) {
            return null;
        }
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != tail && fast.next != tail) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        TreeNode res = new TreeNode(slow.val);
        res.left = buildBST(head, slow);
        res.right = buildBST(slow.next, tail);
        return res;
    }
}

# note
* The idea is to use slow and fast pointers to find the middle element and set it as root, and recursively call the function
on its left side and right side. Since it's an increasing list, the result is a balanced binary search tree.
* Time O(n log(n)). At every level, above algorithm is traversing the full list (in parts) and there are log(n) levels in balanced tree
