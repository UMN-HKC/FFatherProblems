## Solution1
``` java
/* The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
      int read4(char[] buf); */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    private int buffPtr = 0;
    private int buffCnt = 0;
    private char[] buff = new char[4];
    
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int ptr = 0;
        while (ptr < n) {
            if (buffPtr == 0) {           // since ptr < n and buffPtr == 0 which means we can 
                buffCnt = read4(buff);    // start reading more from file by calling read4
            }
            if (buffCnt == 0) {   // end of file 
                return ptr;
            }
            while (ptr < n && buffPtr < buffCnt) {
                buf[ptr++] = buff[buffPtr++];
            }
            if (buffPtr == buffCnt) {   // read to the end of temp buffer
                buffPtr = 0;
            }
        }
        return ptr;
    }
}
```

## note 
* This problem differs from the other one in that it requires multiple calls, so we need class variables to store our buff
array and where in the array we stop reading last time (so we need a pointer and counter).
