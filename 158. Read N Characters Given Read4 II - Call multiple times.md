## Solution1
``` java
/* The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
      int read4(char[] buf); */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    private int buffPtr = 0;
    private int buffCnt = 0;
    private char[] buff = new char[4];
    
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int ptr = 0;
        while (ptr < n) {
            if (buffPtr == 0) {           // since ptr < n and buffPtr == 0 which means we can 
                buffCnt = read4(buff);    // start reading more from file by calling read4
            }
            if (buffCnt == 0) {   // end of file 
                return ptr;
            }
            while (ptr < n && buffPtr < buffCnt) {
                buf[ptr++] = buff[buffPtr++];
            }
            if (buffPtr == buffCnt) {   // we have read to the end of buff array, so we reset it 
                buffPtr = 0;
            }
        }
        return ptr;
    }
}
```

## note 
* This problem differs from the other one in that it requires multiple calls, so we need class variables to store our buff
array and where in the array we stop reading last time (so we need a pointer and counter). Besides those class variables, we 
will use a ptr variable inside each read function to keep track of each reading n request. In the beginning of the while loop,
we will check if we have read all characters in our buff array. If so, we will read more from file by calling read4. In the end of the loop, we will always check whether we have read to the end of buff array, if so, we reset it so that at the beginning of the next iteration, buff array could get updated if needed.
* Note that buf that get's passed into the function is a new buff each time, but the buff we have as our class variable has to store the status from last reading, which means it stores the last reading position and count.
