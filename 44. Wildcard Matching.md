## note
* The idea is to use two pointers to traverse string and pattern respectively. There are several conditions to consider:
1). Two pointers move together: '?' or two characters match
2). When encountering '*', store the index of the asterisk, update the match index in s so that we could go back to it 
later if we have unmatched characters between string and pattern, to start from the next character after the last 
matched index. Increment pointer in p.
3). When characters don't match but there's star before. That's when we utilize the match index to go back to the last 
status and one index further 
4). Otherwise, return false
* After the while loop, skip remaining asterisks in pattern and return true if pointer has traversed through pattern, 
otherwise, return false.
* Time O(m * n) (s="aaaaaaaaaaaa", p="*aaaa")  Space O(1)
