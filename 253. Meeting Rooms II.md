## note
* Greedy algorithm. First, sort increasingly the interval array in terms of their starting time. Next, maintain a 
min heap(priority queue) in terms of interval's end time. So each time we poll an interval from the heap, it is the 
one with the earliest ending time. The idea then, is to compare it with the next interval in our array. if the start
time of the interval in the array is less than the polled interval's ending time, then it must overlap with all the 
rest intervals in the heap, so we will create a new room for it and add it into the heap. Otherwise, we put this 
interval in the heap instead of the last one.
