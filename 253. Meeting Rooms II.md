## note
* time O(nlogn) space O(n)
* Greedy algorithm. First, sort increasingly the interval array in terms of their starting time. Next, maintain a 
min heap(priority queue) in terms of interval's end time. So each time we poll an interval from the heap, it is the 
one with the earliest ending time. The idea then, is to compare it with the next interval in our array. if the start
time of the interval in the array is less than the polled interval's ending time, then it must overlap with all the 
rest intervals in the heap, so we will create a new room for it and add it into the heap. Otherwise, we put this 
interval in the heap instead of the last one.
* If you look at these events in a time line one after another (like stream data), then this solution is a greedy solution.

The heap stores all conflicting events, which must be resolved by independent rooms. The heap's head is the event that has earliest end/finish time. All other events collide with each other mutually in the heap.

When a new event comes (this is the reason that we need to sort by event.start), we greedily choose the event A that finished the earliest (this is the reason that we use minheap on end time). If the new event does not collide with A, then the new event can re-use A's room, or simply extend A's room to the new event's end time.

If the new event collides with A, then it must collide with all events in the heap. So a new room must be created.

The reason for correctness is the invariant: heap size is always the minimum number of rooms we need so far. If the new event collides with everyone, then a new room must be created; if the new event does not collide with someone, then it must not collide with the earliest finish one, so greedily choose that one and re-use that room. So the invariant is maintained.
