``` java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        int[] count = new int[256];
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            count[c]++;
        }
        int minimum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int from = 0;
        int countToMatch = t.length();
        
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (count[s.charAt(i)]-- > 0) {
                countToMatch--;
            }
            while (countToMatch == 0) {
                if (i - j + 1 < minimum) {
                    minimum = i - j + 1;
                    from = j;
                }
                if (++count[s.charAt(j++)] > 0) {
                    countToMatch++;
                }
            }
        }
        return minimum == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(from, from + minimum); 
     }

## notes
* time O(n), space O(1)
* Sliding window problem. The idea is to use an array of size 256 to keep track of only ASCII strings to record frequency of characters in t. Initially, we will traverse t and incremnt respective frequency of characters in t. Then, we iterate through string s to find minimum length of substring that include all characters in t. We will have a variable 'countToMatch'to keep track of whether we have covered all characters in t whose initial value is the length of t. When we iterate through s, the faster pointer decreases "countToMatch" and the slower pointer increases "countToMatch". We move the faster pointer to include 
characters and decrease its value in array. Once "countToMatch == 0, it means we have covered all characters in t, we will first update our result if we have found a narrower window, and will start closing our window by moving our slower pointer to exclude characters and increase its value in array.
* 那么你可能会疑问，对于不在T串中的字母的映射值也这么加呀减呀的，其实没啥事，因为对于不在T串中的字母，我们减1后，变-1，cnt不会增加，之后收缩左边界的时候，映射值加1后为0，cnt也不会减少，所以并没有什么影响啦.
