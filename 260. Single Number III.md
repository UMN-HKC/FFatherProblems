## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int diff = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            diff ^= num;
        }
        diff &= ~(diff - 1);
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for (int num : nums) {
            if ((diff & num) == 0) {
                res[0] ^= num;
            }
            else {
                res[1] ^= num;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to utilize XOR to get XOR of the two unique numbers. Say, a^b = diff. Then,  ```diff &= ~(diff - 1)``` gets us the 
rightmost bit position where these two unique numbers differ from each other. Next, iterate through the array again and XOR each 
number and partition elements into two parts. One part must contain one unique number, and the other contains the other.
