## Solution1 (iterative)
``` java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode suc = null;
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.val > p.val) {
                suc = root;
                root = root.left;
            }
            else {
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        return suc;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) for skewed tree, space O(1)
* The idea is to utilize the characteristic of BST, traverse to left tree if current node's value is greater than p node that
we are looking for and update the successor node to the current node which is potentially our successor. Otherwise, traverse to 
right node.
* Note that it is <strong>root.val > p.val</strong> without equal sign.
