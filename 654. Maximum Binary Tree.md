## Solution1 (use stack, more efficient in theory)
``` java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode constructMaximumBinaryTree(int[] nums) {
        Deque<TreeNode> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            TreeNode cur = new TreeNode(nums[i]);
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek().val < cur.val) {
                cur.left = stack.pop();
            }
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                stack.peek().right = cur;
            }
            stack.push(cur);
        }
        return stack.isEmpty() ? null : stack.removeLast();
    }
}
```
## Solution2 (recursion)
``` java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode constructMaximumBinaryTree(int[] nums) {
        return helper(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }
    private TreeNode helper(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return null;
        }
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int index = -1;
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > max) {
                max = nums[i];
                index = i;
            }
        }
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(max);
        root.left = helper(nums, start, index - 1);
        root.right = helper(nums, index + 1, end);
        
        return root;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(n) for Solution1 / time O(n^2) space O(n) for Solution2
* The idea for solution1 is to iterate through the array once, meanwhile maintain a stack that stores the decreasing sequence 
of numbers in the array. When the current visiting value is greater than the top element in the stack, we keep set its left
child to the top element in the stack and pop it out of the stack. After the loop, if there is still element in the stack, it 
means that element at the top of the stack is greater than the current element we are visiting and since the current element is
on the right of all elements in the stack, we set this element as the right child of the element at the top of the stack, and 
then push this element into the stack. In this way, we've successfully build one more step towards our final tree, and elements 
in the stack maintains decreasing sequence. After we traverse the whole array, we retrieve the last element in the stack which 
is our max tree node(root node).
