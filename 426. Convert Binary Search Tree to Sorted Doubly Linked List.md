## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public Node treeToDoublyList(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        Node leftMost = root;
        while (leftMost.left != null) {
            leftMost = rotate(leftMost);
        }
        Node parent = leftMost;
        Node child = leftMost.right;
        while(child != null) {
            while (child.left != null) {
                child = rotate(child);
            }
            parent.right = child;
            child.left = parent;
            parent = parent.right;
            child = child.right;
        }
        leftMost.left = parent;
        parent.right = leftMost;
        return leftMost;
    }
    
    private Node rotate(Node rotated) {
        Node newRoot = rotated.left;
        rotated.left = newRoot.right;
        newRoot.right = rotated;
        return newRoot;
    }
}
```

## note
* iterative solution. First, starting from the root node and start throwing the left subtree up until the leftmost node become the new root node. Then, go to the right subtree and updating the pointer and if encounter node that has left child, start throwing again.
* remember to connect the leftmost node and rightmost node in the end
