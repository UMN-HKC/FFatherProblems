``` java
class Solution {
    public Node treeToDoublyList(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
        Node head = null, tail = null;
        
        while (root != null || !stack.empty()) {
            while (root != null) {
                stack.push(root);
                root = root.left;
            }
            // at this point, root is null. On the top of stack, is the leftMost node of the tree
            root = stack.pop();
            if (head == null) {
                head = root;
            }
            if (tail != null) {
                tail.right = root;
                root.left = tail;
            }
            tail = root;
            root = root.right;
        }
        head.left = tail;
        tail.right = head;
        return head;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(n)
* In-order traversal, iterative solution. The idea is to point our head node to the leftMost node. For the tail node, we point it to the current node that we are visiting right before we move current pointer to its right node. So, during next iteration, 
we would be able to connect the current node we are visiting to tail node which currently points to current node's left node. 
But after the loop, the tail node stops at the rightMost node of the tree
* Remember to connect the head node and tail node in the end
