## note 
* time O(m^2 * n^2) space O(m * n)
* Traverse the matrix. For each building, use BFS to compute the shortest distance from each '0' to this building. After we do
this for all the buildings, we can get the sum of shortest distance from every '0' to all reachable buildings. This value is 
stored in 'dist[][]'. For example, if grid[2][2] == 0, dist[2][2] is the sum of shortest distance from this block to 
all reachable buildings. We also count how many building each '0' can be reached. It is stored in hits[][]. This can be done 
during the BFS. We also need to count how many total buildings are there in the matrix, which is stored in 'buildingNum'.
Finally, we can traverse the dist[][] matrix to get the point having shortest distance to all buildings. O(m*n)
