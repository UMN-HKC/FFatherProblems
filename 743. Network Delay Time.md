## Solution1 (Dijirstra's algorithm)
``` java

            graph.putIfAbsent(time[0], new ArrayList<>());
            graph.get(time[0]).add(new int[]{time[1], time[2]});

## note
* time O(NlogN + E) space O(N + E)
* Dijirstra's Algorithm. First, we use map to construct our graph where key represents node and its value represents its neighbor
which is a list of array (array of size 2: node and distance). Then, we use priority queue to simulate breadth first search and 
dijirstra's algorithm. Also, we need a boolean array to mark visited nodes. When visiting an unvisited node, we simulate the
"Relaxation" operation in Dijirstra's algorithm by offering nodes into our priority queue in terms of their distance. Thus, 
shorter distance always gets in the front of queue. Within the while loop, we will update our max variable each time a node is 
visited. Finally, we simply return max (if N == 0 which means we have successfully visited all nodes). Why could we directly 
return max? Because, the last time max gets updated is the last node that we visited, where we also get the longest distance from.
