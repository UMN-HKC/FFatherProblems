## note
* time O(V^2 * logV) space O(V)
* The idea is to realize this problem as a graph problem and do dfs after we've built the graph. First, we will need to build 
up the graph by connecting emails in all accounts. We will need two hashmaps: one to map email and its owner, the other to map 
email to this email's owner's all other emails. When doing dfs, remember that after adding all dfs call, sort the emails in 
the list first before adding name to the beginning of the list.
* Remember while iterating through accounts, always map an email with an email before it rather than the other way around, so that we could build a correct graph.
