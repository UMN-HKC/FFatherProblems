## Solution1 (queue)
``` java
class MovingAverage {
    int size;
    double sum;
    Queue<Double> window;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        this.size = size;
        sum = 0;
        window = new LinkedList<>();
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if (window.size() == size) {
            sum -= window.poll();
        }
        window.offer((double)val);
        sum += val;
        return sum / window.size();
    }
}
```

## note 
* time O(1) space O(n)
* The idea is to maintain a bounded queue. When the number of numbers in the queue is less than its capacity, we could keep 
adding numbers. But when it reaches its capacity, we will need to keep a sliding window which means we need to remove a number
from the front of the queue when add a number to the end of the queue.
