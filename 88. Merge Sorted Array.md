## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        if (nums1 == null || nums2 == null) {
            return;
        }     
        int itr = m + n - 1;
        int mItr = m - 1;
        int nItr = n - 1;
 
        while (mItr >= 0 && nItr >= 0) {
            if (nums1[mItr] > nums2[nItr]) {
                nums1[itr--] = nums1[mItr--]; 
            }
            else {
                nums1[itr--] = nums2[nItr--];
            }
        }
        while (nItr >= 0) {
            nums1[itr--] = nums2[nItr--];
        }
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to have a pointer itr that iterates from back of the position of nums1 at m + n - 1 which is the end of the position 
after merging numbers. We will also have other two pointers each iterating from m - 1 of nums1 and  n - 1 of nums2. Compare 
numbers and put the larger number at itr. Update pointers. After the loop, we only need to check if there are more numbers in 
nums2 that haven't been traversed. We don't need to check nums1 since even if some numbers haven't been traversed, they are 
already sorted.
