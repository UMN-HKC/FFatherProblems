## Solution1 (greedy)
``` java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicateLetters(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < 2) {
            return s;
        }
        int[] cnt = new int[26];
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[26];
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (Character c : s.toCharArray()) {
            cnt[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (Character c : s.toCharArray()) {
            cnt[c - 'a']--;
            if (visited[c - 'a']) {
                continue;
            }
            else {
                while (sb.length() != 0 && sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) > c && cnt[sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) - 'a'] != 0) {
                    visited[sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) - 'a'] = false;
                    sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
                }
            }
            visited[c - 'a'] = true;
            sb.append(c);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## note 
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to apply greedy thinking to solve this problem, that is, we always want to keep the front elements as small as 
possible. In here, we use stringbuilder which acts like a stack (we could use stack though). We also need to counter array to 
record frequency of each character and a boolean array to check if we have appended a character to our stringbuilder previously.
Then, the problem is pretty straight-forward. When visiting a character, if it is already visited, we will skip to next one. 
Otherwise, we will delete all characters appended previouslt that are lexicographically greater than the current one, 
<strong>meantime set it as unvisited so that we remember to add it later</strong>.
