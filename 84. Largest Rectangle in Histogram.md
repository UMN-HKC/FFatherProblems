## note
* Time O(n) Space O(n)
* Use stack to keep track of indices as we traverse through the histogram. We will push indices of the bar that is 
in an non-decreasing fashion into the stack. Otherwise, we stop pushing and starting calculating the max area of 
current status of bars we put into our stack so far. We will pop indices from stack until the index in the stack 
reference a smaller bar than the current bar we anchored and in the meantime, we will update the max area. 
* The trick here is to manipulate the index i. Also, setting the conditional to i <= heights.length keep us rolling 
through the last couple of indices in the stack. 
* i - 1 - stack.peek() uses the starting index where heights[stack.peek() + 1] >= heights[peak], because the index on top of the 
stack right now is the first index left of tp with height smaller than peak's height.
