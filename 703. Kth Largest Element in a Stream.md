## Solution1 (min heap)
``` java
class KthLargest {
    int k;
    PriorityQueue<Integer> pq;
    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        this.k = k;
        pq = new PriorityQueue<>(k);
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            add(i);
        }
    }
    
    public int add(int val) {
        if (pq.size() < k) {
            pq.offer(val);
        }
        else {
            if (pq.peek() < val) {
                pq.poll();
                pq.offer(val);
            }
        }
        return pq.peek();
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(k)
* The idea is to use priority queue with size of k. When the number of elements in pq is less than the size, we can simply 
put elements into the pq. When pq reaches its capacity which is k, the top element is the kth largest element. After pq is full
when we add elements into pq, we will compare it with the top element in pq, if it is greater than the top element, we know that
we need to update our priority queue, we do so by polling the top element and offering the current element. Otherwise, we don't
modify our pq.
