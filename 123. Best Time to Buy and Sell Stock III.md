## Solution1 (DP)

``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int[][] dp = new int[3][prices.length];     // one row more than number of actual transactions
        for (int i = 1; i < dp.length; i++) {
            int profitLoss = prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < dp[0].length; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] - profitLoss);  // whether do transaction or not
                profitLoss = Math.min(profitLoss, prices[j] - dp[i - 1][j]);    // get min profit loss 
            }
        }
        return dp[2][dp[0].length - 1];
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n * k) space O(n * k)
* The idea is to use dynamic programming. We will create a 2-d array to store our profit in terms of transactions and days. The row represents the number of transactions and the column represents which day it is. Outer loop iterates through different times of transactions. Each iteration in the inner loop, we will update the maximum profit could be made for i-th transaction on j-th day. </br>
Following line sets the maximum profit which comes from one of the options we have: do transaction or not:
```
dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] - profitLoss);  // whether do transaction or not
```
Then, we reset the profit loss(we want to minimize the profit loss here, so we could maximize the profit gain later). We will get the min profit loss by getting the minimum value between so-far profit loss and buying stock today which causes our current profit.
