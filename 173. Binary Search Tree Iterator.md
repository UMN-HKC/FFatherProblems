## Solution1
``` java
public class BSTIterator {
    Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        while (root != null) {
            stack.push(root);
            root = root.left;
        }
    }

    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return !stack.empty();
    }

    /** @return the next smallest number */
    public int next() {
        TreeNode next = stack.pop();
        TreeNode cur = next;
        int res = cur.val;
        if (cur.right != null) {
            cur = cur.right;
            stack.push(cur);
            while (cur.left != null) {
                cur = cur.left;
                stack.push(cur);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## note
* use stack to simulate in-order traversal, so the space required is to store nodes from top to bottom left initially. 
After that we pop and push node as we do inorder traversal. So the space is O(logn).
* Since the question asks for average time, we have O(n) / n = O(1) for next()
