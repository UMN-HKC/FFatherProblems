## Solution1(dp knapsack)
``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null) {
            return true;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum % 2 != 0 ? false : findSubsets(nums, sum / 2);
    }
    private boolean findSubsets(int[] nums, int target) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[target + 1];
        dp[0] = true; 
        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int i = dp.length - 1; i >= num; i--) {
                dp[i] = dp[i] || dp[i - num];
            }
        }
        return dp[dp.length - 1];
    }
}
```

## note 
* time O(n * target) space O(target)
* The idea is to realize this is dp knapsack problem. The problem could be interpreted as finding if there's a subset that sums
to half of the sum of the whole array. It could be solved using 2d array. But in fact, if we look at the transition function:
<strong>dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-nums[i]]</strong>, we notice that to get dp[i][j], we only need the result of its last
row.
