``` java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] taskFreq = new int[26];
        for (char c : tasks) {
            taskFreq[c - 'A']++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(taskFreq);
        int i = 25;
        while (i >= 0 && taskFreq[i] == taskFreq[25]) i--;
        return Math.max(tasks.length, (taskFreq[25] - 1) * (n + 1) + 25 - i);
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) (sorting is constant in here) space O(1)
* greedy approach. The idea is to find the most frequent task and use it to set up a frame in terms of idle time, and then
we start fill out the frame with less frequent characters equally among the frame. Say, we have 'FFFAAACC' and idleTime = 2, 
so we will initialize the frame as F _ _ F _ _ F. Note that we don't need to reserve extra frame after the last F. As we 
start filling out the frame, the frame becomes F A _ F A _ , and then F A C F A C, and finally we append the number of 
different characters of same frequency to the end of the frame. The result would be (array[25] - 1) * (n + 1) + (25 - i).
25 - i means the number of most frequent characters in the string. 
* There might be some case when there are still characters left to fill but the frame is full already, like case(AAABBB 0). To handle this case, the size of the original task ought be greater than our frame. So we returned the larger one between these two to cover this situation.
