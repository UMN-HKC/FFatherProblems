      int read4(char[] buf); */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int total = 0;
        char[] temp = new char[4];
        while (total < n) {
            int count = Math.min(read4(temp), n - total);
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                buf[total++] = temp[i];
            }
            if (count < 4) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}

## note 
* The problem is to read characters from a file to a buffer char array that's passed in to us, so we need a temp char array to 
catch all read in characters and read required number of characters then to the buffer array. In the while loop, we need to first store how many characters we need to read to the buffer. By getting the min between read4(temp) and n - total, we will not read more than what we want. Then, we read from our temp array to buffer. Before we enter another iterationm, we check if we have read to the end of the file by checking if count is less than 4. If so, we break the loop and return the total. Otherwise, we continue to the next iteration.
