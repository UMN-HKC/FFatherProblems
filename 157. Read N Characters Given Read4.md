## Solution1
``` java
/* The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
      int read4(char[] buf); */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int total = 0;
        char[] temp = new char[4];
        while (total < n) {
            int count = Math.min(read4(temp), n - total);
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                buf[total++] = temp[i];
            }
            if (count < 4) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

## note 
* The key to solve this problem is to understand correctly the question. We don't read from our buffer, instead, we read
from some unknown file to the buffer, and the maximum bytes we are reading is n
