## Solution1
``` java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null)   return false;
        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false; 
    }
}
```

## note 
* time O(n) spoace O(1)
* The idea is to use a slow and fast pointer, a fast pointer each time forwards 2 steps and slow pointer moves 1 step. If 
at some point of time, they equal to each other, it means they meet each other in the list which indicates a cycle in the list.
