## note 

* This problem is asking for all words in the dictionary that appear in our matrix. If simply doing dfs, it will take way too
much time. So, we make use of **Trie** data structure to prestore dictionary and then start traverse matrix as well as trie. 
There are two tricks we make in our implementation. When building our trie structure, we will store the complete word as an 
attribute in this word's last position in trie. Thus, when we find a word, we could set it as null to avoid duplications. 
The other trick is that we modify our matrix directly when backtracking instead of using an extra 2d array.

### time/space complexity analysis
* Naive way is to search for every word in the dictionary directly by DFS all cells for every word. 
The time complexity will be O(m * n * l * wl) where n is board.length, m is board[0].length, 
l is words.length and wl is the average of length of words in 'words'.

* With a Trie to check multiple words at the same time when DFS from a certain cell,
Time: O(m * n * wl) = max(O(l * wl), O(m * n * l * wl)) where
O(l * wl) - Build the trie
O(m * n * l * wl) - In the worst case where all words start with different chracters, and there is 
a word starting with a character in the cell board[m - 1][n - 1], we have O(m * n * l * wl). However, 
if there are words starting with same characters and paths sharing cells, Trie can check multiple 
words when DFS from a certain cell, rather than check only one word when DFS from a certain cell like the naive way.

* Space: O(l * wl) = max(O(wl), O(l * wl)) where
O(wl) - The recursive stack can grow at most to wl layers. 
O(l * wl) - In the worst case when all words start with different characters, the trie has l * wl nodes. Also, since each 
word is stored in a leaf node, all the leaf nodes require l * wl memory.
