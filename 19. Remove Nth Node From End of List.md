## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy, slow = dummy;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        slow.next = slow.next.next;
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) Space O(1)
* The idea is to use a fast and slow pointer and they all start at the dummy node we create (the dummy node deals with the edge
case when we want to delete the first node which is the head). The fast pointer will first forward for n steps, and then slow 
and fast pointers will forward one step each time at the same time until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list. Then 
we set slow pointer's next to its next's next node. Because fast pointer is n steps ahead of slow pointer and since fast pointer has reached the 
end of the list, so where the slow pointer's next is at is the nth node from the end of the list.
