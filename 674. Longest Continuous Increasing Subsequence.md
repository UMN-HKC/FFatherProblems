``` java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int max = 1, i = 0, j = 1;
        while (j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[j] > nums[j - 1]) {
                j++;
            }
            else {
                i = j;
                j = i + 1;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, j - i);
        }
        return max;
    }
}

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is to use two pointers and iterate through the array and update the longest continuous increasing subsequence.
One pointer keeps track of the starting point, the other keeps moving while the current value is greater than its previous one.
For each moves, we update max if we get a longer length. Once it meets a non-increasing value, we update the other pointer to 
this point and move this pointer to one index forward. The loop ends when the iterating pointer reaches the end.
