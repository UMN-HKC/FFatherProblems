## note
* time O(1) space O(n)
* Since we know that to win a game, we only need to have one row, or one column or one left diagnal or one right diagnal placed
with all of one player's moves, so we don't actually need a 2-d array to keep track of that. Instead, we only need two 1-d arrays 
to keep track of rows and cols and two variables to keep track of left diagnal and right diagnal.
