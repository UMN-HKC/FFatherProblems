``` java
/* The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
      boolean knows(int a, int b); */

public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int candidate = 0;
        //  this for loop excludes all unqualified people
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (knows(candidate, i)) {
                candidate = i;
            }
        }
        // this for loop checks if this person is really the celebrity
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i != candidate && (!knows(i, candidate) || knows(candidate, i))) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return candidate;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n * knows) space O(1)
* The idea is to two pass the line of people. The first pass compare contiguous people and after the first loop, we have excluded
all unqualified-as-celebrity people, in other word, we have a candidate for being a celebrity. The second loop, we will check 
if everyone else knows this candidate, and if this candidate not know everyone else.
